**Luxury watches have become more and more popular among affluent people as investments in their portfolios, which has increased demand and, consequently, value in the watch market. Prior to the pandemic, the watch industry witnessed an unprecedented surge in demand for high-end luxury timepieces, with some fetching six figures for their purchase.**
**It wasn't always this way, despite the industry's recent dramatic growth. For this reason, we have chosen to examine the worth of watches and the performance of the various brands over time.**

**ASPECTS TO COVER**
 - First wristwatches commercially made
 - Most expensive watches and a bit about their history
 - Ideal case size over time
 - Number of watches released per year and price correlation
 - Evolution of price since first commercial release

 **STEPS TO TAKE**
 - Data cleaning and formatting – looking for duplicates and null values to eliminate
 - Formatting column names
 - Data formatting – change column type to a more usable format where necessary
 - Perform analysis on specific columns
 - Create visualisations
 - Extract data to be vizualised
